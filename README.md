## About
We started off this project with our focus on global terrorism and its impact. As we are moving along the project we thought to narrow down our focus on the major terrorist groups and their impact on the world. We try to find a relationship between terrorist organizations and the attacks by plotting the graphs. 

Insights: We find that terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Taliban are the major organizations from the bubble graph which have made the maximum number of attacks. We can see that maximum number of attacks made by Taliban across the past few years particularly 2000â€™s.
